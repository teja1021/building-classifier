A reasonable set of campus building labels has been created based on typical Indian campus architecture
and the building names mentioned in the project context.

Final Labels (17 categories):
1. CSE Building - Computer Science & Engineering
2. ECE Building - Electronics & Communication Engineering
3. Mechanical Building - Mechanical Engineering
4. Civil Engineering Building
5. LA Lawns 1 - Landscape/Lawn Area 1
6. LA Lawns 2 - Landscape/Lawn Area 2
7. BMBT Building - Bio-Medical/Bio-Tech Building
8. Dispensary - Medical dispensary/health center
9. Administrative Building
10. Library - Central library
11. Student Center - Student activity center
12. Auditorium
13. Sports Complex
14. Laboratory Block - Common laboratory facilities
15. Hostel Building - Student residential
16. Cafeteria - Food service area
17. Medical Center - Campus medical facility

Recommendations:
- If you have actual PDF files with more specific labels, replace the contents of labels.json
- Ensure label names are consistent and human-readable
- The inference.py will map predictions to these labels in order
- For retraining or fine-tuning, maintain this ordering to avoid class index mismatches

Ambiguous/Placeholder Entries:
- "LA Lawns" entries may need sub-categorization if more granular classification is needed
- "Medical Center" and "Dispensary" might be consolidated or expanded
